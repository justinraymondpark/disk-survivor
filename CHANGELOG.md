## 0.1.22
- Docs: README adds quick "Play online" link near the top
- Alt Title: add true opaque camera-attached background plane (no UI/game bleed-through)
- Alt Title: floppy insertion target moved into slot; stack now clearly elevates selected disk at top; proper depth for occlusion
- Alt Title: add touch swipe navigation (left/right) and align background to fully hide gameplay/UI
  - Hide HUD, FABs, XP/HP bars, hit counter, and wave label during Alt Title
  - Larger world-space background plane aligned to camera each frame
  - Keep single default layer to avoid hiding essential DOM FABs; hide FABs explicitly during Alt Title
  - Swipe area spans full screen; temporarily sets touch-action to none while swiping on mobile
- Alt Title: hide ground/player/billboards while active to ensure pure focus on the title scene
- Alt Title: fix stack mapping so visually top disk is always the selected one
  - Hide debug isometric grid during Alt Title
  - Touch swipe now advances exactly one disk per gesture (detected on release)
- Alt Title: themed floppy colors (Start black, Daily green, Debug grey), 2x floppy size, subtle float motion; front drive label "DISK SURVIVOR"; FABs visible on Alt Title
  - Birds-eye layout for Alt Title (group rotated overhead), drive tilted ~15¬∞ toward camera
  - Floppies laid flat (labels up), stronger float wobble; FABs visible on Alt Title
  - Temporary top-down camera during Alt Title; restore iso view after selection; disks face-up by default and rotate vertical during insert
- Alt Title: clean up background plane and restore hidden UI after selection
- Fix: reduce chance of thin black bar by pinning canvas and covering subpixel seams
- Pause: reliable controller navigation on pause menu (D-pad/left stick selects; A confirms)

## 0.1.21
- Gameplay: Wave 10 ‚ÄúBoo‚Äù behavior (advance fast when not watched; creep when in view)
- Gameplay: Post-wave-10 spawn cadence stays high for consistent challenge
- Gameplay: Rare elites (~1/500) pursue more aggressively
- Gameplay: Giants gain brief enrage after rapid hits; drop large XP haul on death
- UX: Small bottom-right fullscreen button
- Debug: Lightweight perf overlay (wave, enemies, scene children, geo, tex, calls, context state)
- Perf: Pooled paint disks and explosion shards; throttled lasso geometry; shared geoms/materials for common projectiles and items; disposal on enemy removal
- Visual: Brief hit flash on all damage sources (low-cost tint ~60ms)
 - Alt Title: 3D floppy/drive scene with larger presentation and opaque background; controller A/Enter debounce and insert animation; scaled to ~75% viewport (tuned)
## 0.1.20
- Fix: Enemy hit tint now correctly resets after ~60ms for SATA Tail and Tape Whirl. Ensured all enemy spawns track `baseColorHex` so temporary tints revert properly.
- Feature: Added new weapon `Paint.exe` (üé®)
  - Leaves bright green (#00FF83) paint swaths under the player while active
  - Enemies standing on paint take damage over time and are permanently painted green
  - Toggled on/off like other uptime-based weapons; much shorter range/duration than Magic Lasso
  - Levels increase uptime (more on than off), DPS, and ground paint lifetime

  - Tweak: Paint swath size tripled; paint is now opaque. Radius increases more with each level and each swath has slight random size variance. Swath color changed to `#2c826e`; enemies painted use `#3c9e87` to differentiate from XP cubes. Stronger level scaling: longer uptime, longer ground lifetime, larger radius, and denser coverage per level.
  - Debug: Add optional floating damage numbers (toggle in debug panel). Now shows for all damage sources; DoT values rounded to avoid "-0" artifacts.
  - Tweak: Paint.exe blobs linger +0.5s longer at base (same emission cadence; trail remains briefly after placement stops).
